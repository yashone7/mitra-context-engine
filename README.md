# mitra-context-engine

Mitra is a calm, consent-based context engine.

It helps you externalize thinking, hold responsibility safely, and surface **one stabilizing action at a time** — without pressure, urgency, or judgment.

This is **not** a task manager, planner, or productivity tool.  
It is personal cognitive infrastructure.

## Why Mitra exists

Modern work creates:
- fragmented conversations
- overlapping responsibilities
- open loops that live in your head

For people in leadership roles — especially those who are neurodivergent — this results in constant background cognitive load.

Mitra exists to answer a single question:

> **“Given everything I’ve already accepted as real, what is the one thing I should do now?”**

No dashboards.  
No priorities.  
No reminders.

Just clarity.

## Core principles

Mitra is built on a few non-negotiable ideas:

### 1. State over chat  
Mitra stores structured state, not conversations.  
It remembers context so you don’t have to.

### 2. Consent over automation  
Nothing becomes a real commitment without explicit confirmation.  
The system may suggest — it never decides for you.

### 3. Deterministic over intelligent  
AI is used only to translate language into structure.  
All decisions are deterministic and explainable.

### 4. One action at a time  
Mitra never shows lists of work.  
Decision fatigue is treated as a design bug.

### 5. Calm by design  
If a feature increases cognitive load, it does not ship.

## How Mitra works

The entire system revolves around a simple loop:
